# Spellforce-campaign-multiplayer
Mod allows to playing in singleplayer or multiplayer campaign with Freegame gamemode






Knows problems:
1. I cant play again on xyz map. 
Its rare problem with script duplication, before join to map what you choice, you have to join other map, save game and quit, its everything.

2. Some enemies bases dont exist like in oryginal campaing.
You choose normal or less enemies option, if you want play with normal amount of bases choose option "more enemies".

3. High-tier chest have other loots.
You still using gamedata created ONLY for multiplayer campaing, please load your old gamedata.
